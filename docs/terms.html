      <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
      <p class="legal-updated">Last updated: February 23, 2026</p>

      <p>By accessing or using Daily Stock Guide ("the Site," "we," "us," or "our"), located at dailystockguide.com, you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service ("Terms"). If you do not agree to these Terms, do not use the Site.</p>

      <h2>1. Nature of the Service</h2>
      <p>Daily Stock Guide is a free, publicly available tool that screens for stocks that have experienced significant price declines and presents historical statistical data about how similar setups have performed in the past. The Site generates an "Opportunity Score" and related metrics based on historical pattern matching.</p>

      <h2>2. Not Financial Advice</h2>
      <p>The Site does not provide financial advice, investment advice, trading advice, or any other form of professional advice. All content, data, scores, probabilities, and analysis presented on the Site are for <strong>informational and educational purposes only</strong>.</p>
      <p>Nothing on this Site constitutes a recommendation, solicitation, or offer to buy or sell any securities, financial instruments, or investments of any kind. You should not interpret any content on this Site as a substitute for professional financial advice from a qualified financial advisor, broker, or other licensed professional.</p>

      <h2>3. No Guarantees of Performance</h2>
      <p><strong>Past performance does not predict, guarantee, or indicate future results.</strong> Historical data, probabilities, backtest results, and statistical analysis shown on the Site reflect what happened in the past under specific conditions and may not repeat in the future. Stock prices can and do go to zero. You can lose some or all of your invested capital.</p>
      <p>The Opportunity Score, probability figures, and all other metrics are purely historical and statistical in nature. A high score does not mean a stock will increase in value.</p>

      <h2>4. Assumption of Risk</h2>
      <p>You acknowledge and agree that:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>All investment and trading decisions are made solely by you, at your own risk.</li>
        <li>You are solely responsible for any financial losses or gains resulting from your decisions.</li>
        <li>You will conduct your own independent research and due diligence before making any investment decisions.</li>
        <li>You will consult with a qualified financial professional before making investment decisions if needed.</li>
        <li>Investing in stocks involves substantial risk of loss, including the potential loss of your entire investment.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>5. Data Accuracy</h2>
      <p>While we strive to provide accurate and up-to-date information, we make <strong>no representations or warranties</strong> regarding the accuracy, completeness, reliability, timeliness, or suitability of any data, analysis, or content on the Site. Data may contain errors, omissions, or delays. Market data is sourced from third-party providers and may not reflect real-time prices or conditions.</p>
      <p>We are not responsible for any errors or inaccuracies in the data presented, regardless of the cause.</p>

      <h2>6. Limitation of Liability</h2>
      <p>To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, Daily Stock Guide, its owner(s), operators, affiliates, and contributors shall not be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, consequential, punitive, or exemplary damages, including but not limited to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Financial losses from investment or trading decisions</li>
        <li>Loss of profits, revenue, data, or goodwill</li>
        <li>Damages resulting from reliance on any content or data on the Site</li>
        <li>Damages resulting from errors, omissions, or inaccuracies in the data</li>
        <li>Damages resulting from interruption or unavailability of the Site</li>
        <li>Any other damages arising from the use of or inability to use the Site</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This limitation applies regardless of the legal theory (contract, tort, negligence, strict liability, or otherwise), even if we have been advised of the possibility of such damages.</p>

      <h2>7. Indemnification</h2>
      <p>You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Daily Stock Guide, its owner(s), operators, affiliates, and contributors from and against any and all claims, liabilities, damages, losses, costs, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) arising out of or in connection with your use of the Site, your violation of these Terms, or your investment or trading decisions.</p>

      <h2>8. Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
      <p>The Site is provided on an <strong>"AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE"</strong> basis without any warranties of any kind, either express or implied, including but not limited to implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, accuracy, or reliability.</p>
      <p>We do not warrant that the Site will be uninterrupted, error-free, secure, or free of viruses or other harmful components.</p>

      <h2>9. Use Restrictions</h2>
      <p>You agree not to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Use the Site for any unlawful purpose</li>
        <li>Scrape, crawl, or use automated tools to extract data from the Site without permission</li>

      <p>We reserve the right to restrict or terminate your access to the Site at any time, for any reason, without notice or liability.</p>

      <h2>14. Severability</h2>
