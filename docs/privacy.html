      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p class="legal-updated">Last updated: February 24, 2026</p>

      <p>Daily Stock Guide ("the Site," "we," "us," or "our"), located at dailystockguide.com, is committed to transparency about how we handle information. This Privacy Policy explains what data we collect (and don't collect) when you visit the Site.</p>

      <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
      <p>We do not collect personal information such as names, email addresses, or account credentials. Specifically:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>No account registration</strong> — The Site does not require or offer user accounts.</li>
        <li><strong>No email collection</strong> — We do not collect email addresses or other contact information.</li>
        <li><strong>No personal data</strong> — We do not collect names or other personally identifiable information you provide directly.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>2. Analytics</h2>
      <p>We use <strong>Google Analytics</strong> (Google tag ID: G-WQQ9QE0FW6) to understand how visitors use the Site. Google Analytics collects information such as:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Pages visited and time spent on the Site</li>
        <li>Referring website or source</li>
        <li>Browser type, device type, and screen resolution</li>
        <li>Approximate geographic location (city/country level, derived from IP address)</li>
        <li>IP address (anonymized by Google Analytics by default)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This data is collected using cookies set by Google Analytics. The information is processed in aggregate to help us improve the Site. We do not use this data to identify individual visitors. For more information on how Google processes this data, see <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Google's Privacy Policy</a> and <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on</a>.</p>

      <h2>3. Ticker Searches</h2>
      <p>When you search for or analyze a stock ticker on the Site, that request may be processed by our server to generate analysis results. These requests are not logged, stored, or associated with any identifying information.</p>

      <h2>4. Hosting and Server Logs</h2>
      <p>The Site is hosted on third-party infrastructure. Our hosting provider may automatically collect minimal server logs (such as IP addresses and request timestamps) as part of standard web server operation. We do not access, use, or analyze these logs for any purpose. Please refer to our hosting provider's privacy policy for details on their data practices.</p>

      <h2>5. Third-Party Services</h2>
      <p>The Site may load resources (such as fonts) from third-party services. These services may collect limited technical information as part of delivering their content. We do not control the data practices of these third parties. Currently, the Site loads web fonts from Google Fonts, which is subject to <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Google's Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

      <h2>6. Children's Privacy</h2>
      <p>The Site is not directed at individuals under the age of 18. We do not knowingly collect any information from children. The Site provides financial data and analysis that is intended for adult audiences.</p>

      <h2>7. Data Security</h2>
      <p>We take reasonable measures to maintain the security and integrity of the Site. Analytics data is processed by Google in accordance with their security practices.</p>

      <h2>8. Future Changes</h2>
      <p>If we introduce additional features that involve data collection in the future (such as user accounts or subscriptions), we will update this Privacy Policy before implementing those changes. We encourage you to review this page periodically.</p>
      <p>When updated, the "Last updated" date at the top of this page will be revised accordingly.</p>

      <h2>9. Your Rights</h2>
      <p>You can opt out of Google Analytics tracking by installing the <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on</a>. You can also clear or block cookies through your browser settings. If you have any privacy-related questions, please contact us using the information below.</p>

      <h2>10. California Residents (CCPA)</h2>
      <p>Under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), California residents have specific rights regarding their personal information. The analytics data we collect through Google Analytics is used solely for Site improvement and is not sold to third parties. Should our data practices change, we will update this policy to fully comply with CCPA requirements.</p>

      <h2>11. European Visitors (GDPR)</h2>
      <p>If you are visiting from the European Economic Area (EEA), you have rights under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Our use of Google Analytics is based on legitimate interest in understanding Site usage. You may opt out at any time using the tools described in Section 9. Should our data practices change, we will update this policy and implement appropriate mechanisms for exercising your rights.</p>
