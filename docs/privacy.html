      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p class="legal-updated">Last updated: February 23, 2026</p>

      <p>Daily Stock Guide ("the Site," "we," "us," or "our"), located at dailystockguide.com, is committed to transparency about how we handle information. This Privacy Policy explains what data we collect (and don't collect) when you visit the Site.</p>

      <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
      <p>We do not currently collect, store, or process any personal information from visitors. Specifically:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>No account registration</strong> — The Site does not require or offer user accounts.</li>
        <li><strong>No email collection</strong> — We do not collect email addresses or other contact information.</li>
        <li><strong>No cookies</strong> — We do not set cookies or use similar tracking technologies.</li>
        <li><strong>No analytics</strong> — We do not currently use analytics services (such as Google Analytics) to track visitor behavior.</li>
        <li><strong>No personal data</strong> — We do not collect names, IP addresses, location data, or any other personally identifiable information.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>2. Ticker Searches</h2>
      <p>When you search for or analyze a stock ticker on the Site, that request may be processed by our server to generate analysis results. These requests are not logged, stored, or associated with any identifying information.</p>

      <h2>3. Hosting and Server Logs</h2>
      <p>The Site is hosted on third-party infrastructure. Our hosting provider may automatically collect minimal server logs (such as IP addresses and request timestamps) as part of standard web server operation. We do not access, use, or analyze these logs for any purpose. Please refer to our hosting provider's privacy policy for details on their data practices.</p>

      <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
      <p>The Site may load resources (such as fonts) from third-party services. These services may collect limited technical information as part of delivering their content. We do not control the data practices of these third parties. Currently, the Site loads web fonts from Google Fonts, which is subject to <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Google's Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

      <h2>5. Children's Privacy</h2>
      <p>The Site is not directed at individuals under the age of 18. We do not knowingly collect any information from children. The Site provides financial data and analysis that is intended for adult audiences.</p>

      <h2>6. Data Security</h2>
      <p>Since we do not collect personal data, there is no personal information at risk. However, we take reasonable measures to maintain the security and integrity of the Site itself.</p>

      <h2>7. Future Changes</h2>
      <p>If we introduce features that involve data collection in the future (such as user accounts, subscriptions, or analytics), we will update this Privacy Policy before implementing those changes. We encourage you to review this page periodically.</p>
      <p>When updated, the "Last updated" date at the top of this page will be revised accordingly.</p>

      <h2>8. Your Rights</h2>
      <p>Since we do not collect personal data, there is generally no personal information for us to provide, modify, or delete. If you believe we hold any information about you in error, or if you have any privacy-related questions, please contact us using the information below.</p>

      <h2>9. California Residents (CCPA)</h2>
      <p>Under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), California residents have specific rights regarding their personal information. As we do not collect personal information, these provisions do not currently apply. Should this change, we will update this policy to fully comply with CCPA requirements.</p>

      <h2>10. European Visitors (GDPR)</h2>
      <p>If you are visiting from the European Economic Area (EEA), you have rights under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). As we do not collect personal data, these provisions do not currently apply. Should this change, we will update this policy and implement appropriate legal bases for any data processing, as well as mechanisms for exercising your rights.</p>

      <h2>11. Contact</h2>
      <p>If you have questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy, please reach out via the contact information provided on the Site.</p>
