                <li><strong>Opportunity Score</strong> — How good this buying opportunity looks right now. Combines stock quality (is this a strong stock?) with recovery odds (has it bounced back from pullbacks like this before?). Higher = better opportunity.</li>
                <li><strong>Pullback</strong> — How far this stock has dropped relative to its own history. 0 = no pullback, 100 = extreme selloff. Stocks need a meaningful pullback to appear as a top opportunity.</li>
                <li><strong>1Y / 3Y / 5Y Prob</strong> — The chance this stock was higher after 1, 3, or 5 years when it was in a similar pullback. For example, "92%" means it was higher 92 out of 100 times.</li>
                <li><strong>Quality</strong> — Is this a strong stock having a temporary dip, or a weak stock that might keep falling? Looks at: Does it usually trend up over time? Has it recovered from past drops? Is the selling slowing down?</li>
                <li><strong>Typical 1Y</strong> — The most common 1-year return when this stock was in a similar situation before.</li>
                <li><strong>Downside</strong> — A bad-but-realistic scenario (worst 1 in 10 outcomes).</li>
                <li><strong>Past Cases</strong> — How many similar historical situations the stats are based on. More = more reliable.</li>

                <li><strong>Find matching history</strong> — Look for every past day this stock was in a similar position.</li>
                <li><strong>Check quality</strong> — Filter for stocks with strong long-term trends and a history of bouncing back.</li>
                <li><strong>Show the odds</strong> — Report what happened next across 1, 3, and 5 years in those past cases.</li>
