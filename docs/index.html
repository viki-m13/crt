          <div class="section-title">What this does</div>
          <p>
            Rebound Ledger runs once a day and surfaces stocks that look <strong>unusually oversold for their own history</strong> —
            <strong>but only after removing the part explained by the market</strong>.
            Then it answers the only question that matters: <em>when this stock looked like this before, what happened next?</em>
            You get forward outcome summaries for 1, 3, and 5 years, plus an explicit comparison to the stock’s “normal day” baseline.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is not “price is down, therefore buy.”
            The model is <strong>stock‑specific</strong> and <strong>market‑adjusted</strong>: a -8% move means something totally different
            for a low‑vol staple than for a high‑beta growth name, and a broad market selloff is not treated as special.
            The scanner looks for <em>idiosyncratic</em> weakness (the stock falling in a way that can’t be dismissed as “SPY did it”),
            and it scores today relative to that stock’s own distribution.
          </p>

          <div class="section-title" style="margin-top:14px">What this is not</div>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Not market advice.</strong> It does not tell you what you “should” own or how to build your portfolio.</li>
            <li><strong>Not a trading strategy.</strong> No entries/exits, position sizing, timing rules, or risk management plan.</li>
            <li><strong>Not a forecast.</strong> It summarizes historical outcomes; it does not predict the future.</li>
            <li><strong>Not a guarantee.</strong> Stocks can keep falling — including to zero.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div>
          <div class="section-title">How it works</div>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <strong>Measure today (per stock).</strong>
              Drawdown from the 52‑week high, position inside the 52‑week range, volatility/volume stress,
              and <strong>market‑adjusted weakness</strong> (how much the stock underperformed broad benchmarks on the way down).
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Remove the “market did it” excuse.</strong>
              If the whole market dropped, that’s not special. The model estimates each stock’s sensitivity to the market and
              tracks the <em>stock‑specific</em> component. That’s why “after removing market moves” is a real edge: you’re not just
              buying a market dip with a different ticker.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Match to the closest historical analogs.</strong>
              It searches the stock’s own history for the <span class="mono">K</span> most similar days (same stock, similar conditions),
              rather than comparing different companies to each other.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Show the evidence vs “typical.”</strong>
              The cards include an explicit <strong>Evidence</strong> block:
              the stock’s outcomes after its <strong>top‑10% most washed‑out days</strong> versus the outcomes after <strong>any random historical day</strong>.
              The difference is the per‑ticker “alpha” this tool is designed to surface.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Rank by strength + reliability.</strong>
              A higher score means rebounds were historically stronger <em>and</em> the evidence is more consistent.
              Confidence/Stability penalize “one lucky episode” patterns.
            </li>
          </ol>
        </div>

        <div>
          <div class="section-title">How to read the numbers</div>
          <ul>
            <li><span class="mono">Chance of gain</span> = % of similar past days where the forward return was positive.</li>
            <li><span class="mono">Typical</span> = the median forward return (the “middle” outcome).</li>
            <li><span class="mono">Downside (1 in 10)</span> = the 10th percentile (a bad‑but‑plausible case).</li>
            <li><span class="mono">Based on N</span> = how many historical analog days were used (bigger N = more evidence).</li>
            <li>
              The <strong>Evidence</strong> bullets inside each card compare “washout‑like” outcomes to that stock’s <em>typical</em>
              outcomes — that’s how you see whether the signal adds alpha for that specific ticker.
            </li>
