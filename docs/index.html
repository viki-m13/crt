              <ul>
                <li><strong>Opportunity Score</strong> — How good this buying opportunity looks right now. Multiplies three things: stock quality (is this a strong stock?), recovery odds (has it bounced back from pullbacks like this before?), and the pullback gate (is it actually in a dip right now?). Stocks near all-time highs score low regardless of quality. Higher = better opportunity.</li>
                <li><strong>Pullback</strong> — How washed-out this stock is right now. 0 = no pullback, 100 = extreme selloff. This is the gate: stocks need a meaningful pullback before the Opportunity Score gives them credit. The deeper the pullback, the more weight the score carries.</li>
                <li><strong>Value Depth</strong> — Shown in the rationale for top stocks. Measures undervaluation across four dimensions: position in the 52-week range, distance below the 200-day moving average, RSI oversold level, and drawdown depth. 0 = near highs, 100 = deep value.</li>
                <li><strong>1Y / 3Y / 5Y Prob</strong> — The chance this stock was higher after 1, 3, or 5 years when it was in a similar pullback. For example, "92%" means it was higher 92 out of 100 times.</li>
                <li><strong>Quality</strong> — Is this a strong stock having a temporary dip, or a weak stock that might keep falling? Looks at: Does it usually trend up over time? Has it recovered from past drops? Is the selling slowing down?</li>
                <li><strong>Typical 1Y</strong> — The most common 1-year return when this stock was in a similar situation before.</li>
                <li><strong>Downside</strong> — A bad-but-realistic scenario (worst 1 in 10 outcomes).</li>
                <li><strong>Past Cases</strong> — How many similar historical situations the stats are based on. More = more reliable.</li>
              </ul>
            </div>
            <div>
              <div class="section-title">How it works</div>
              <ol>
                <li><strong>Measure value depth</strong> — Score each stock on four dimensions: where it sits in its 52-week range, how far below its 200-day moving average, RSI oversold level, and drawdown from recent highs.</li>
                <li><strong>Strip out the market</strong> — Remove broad market moves so we only see the stock's own weakness, not just a bad day for everything.</li>
                <li><strong>Find matching history</strong> — Look for every past day this stock was in a similar position (similar drawdown, similar range position, similar technical setup).</li>
                <li><strong>Check quality</strong> — Filter for stocks with strong long-term trends and a history of bouncing back. This prevents "value traps" — cheap stocks that stay cheap.</li>
                <li><strong>Apply the pullback gate</strong> — Only give high scores to stocks that are actually in a pullback. A stock near all-time highs gets almost no score, no matter how good its quality or history.</li>
                <li><strong>Show the odds</strong> — Report what happened next across 1, 3, and 5 years in those matched past cases.</li>

          This backtest uses the historical opportunity scores — which combine stock quality, recovery odds, and the pullback gate — to pick the top stocks each month, buys them, holds for a fixed period, then sells. Only stocks with meaningful pullbacks get high scores, so the strategy naturally buys dips. All proceeds stay as cash — no reinvestment. Stocks only — crypto (BTC &amp; ETH) is excluded, and including them would improve results even further.</p>
