          <div class="section-title">What this does</div>
          <p>
            Rebound Ledger runs once a day and asks a simple question for each Russell 1000 stock:
            is the stock unusually weak <em>for itself</em> after accounting for what the overall market did?
            If yes, it finds the <span class="mono">K</span> most similar historical days for <em>that same stock</em>
            and summarizes what tended to happen next over 1, 3, and 5 years.
          </p>
          <p>
            The edge is that the signal is <strong>stock-specific</strong> and <strong>market-adjusted</strong>.
            A -8% slide means something totally different for a low-vol staple than for a high-beta growth name.
            This normalizes today’s “washed-out” condition to <em>that stock’s own history</em>, not a one-size-fits-all rule.
          </p>

          <div class="section-title" style="margin-top:14px">What this is not</div>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Not market advice.</strong> It does not tell you what you “should” own or how to build your portfolio.</li>
            <li><strong>Not a trading strategy.</strong> No entries/exits, position sizing, timing rules, or risk management plan.</li>
            <li><strong>Not a forecast.</strong> It summarizes historical outcomes; it does not predict the future.</li>
            <li><strong>Not a guarantee.</strong> Stocks can keep falling — including to zero.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div>
          <div class="section-title">How it works</div>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <strong>Measure today (per stock).</strong>
              Drawdown from the 52-week high, position inside the 52-week range, volatility/volume stress,
              and <strong>market-adjusted weakness</strong> (how much the stock underperformed broad benchmarks on the way down).
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Remove the “market did it” excuse.</strong>
              If the whole market dropped, that’s not special.
              The model focuses on days where the stock looks weak even <em>after</em> you account for broad moves.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Match to the closest historical analogs.</strong>
              It searches the stock’s own history for the <span class="mono">K</span> most similar days (same stock, similar conditions),
              rather than comparing different companies to each other.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Show the evidence vs “typical.”</strong>
              For each horizon (1Y/3Y/5Y), it summarizes what happened after those similar “washout” days and compares that to
              what the stock usually did after a random day. That gap is the <em>alpha</em> you care about.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Rank by strength + reliability.</strong>
              A higher score means rebounds were historically stronger <em>and</em> the evidence is more consistent.
              Confidence/Stability penalize “one lucky episode” patterns.
            </li>
          </ol>
        </div>

        <div>
          <div class="section-title">How to read the numbers</div>
          <ul>
            <li><span class="mono">Chance of gain</span> = % of similar past days where the forward return was positive.</li>
            <li><span class="mono">Typical</span> = the median forward return (the “middle” outcome).</li>
            <li><span class="mono">Downside (1 in 10)</span> = the 10th percentile (a bad-but-plausible case).</li>
            <li><span class="mono">Based on N</span> = how many historical analog days were used (bigger N = more evidence).</li>
            <li>
              The <strong>Evidence</strong> bullets inside each card compare “washout-like” outcomes to that stock’s <em>typical</em>
              outcomes — that’s how you see whether the signal adds alpha for that specific ticker.
            </li>
          </ul>

        <p>
          Conceptually, each stock has a daily feature vector <span class="mono">x<sub>t</sub></span> that captures “washout-ness”:
          drawdown, range percentile, volatility/volume stress, and market-adjusted underperformance.
          The model standardizes these features within the stock’s own history, then finds the <span class="mono">K</span>
          nearest historical days by a weighted distance.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><span class="mono">Similarity</span>: find past days <span class="mono">s</span> minimizing <span class="mono">d(t,s)=\sqrt{\sum_j w_j (x_{t,j}-x_{s,j})^2}</span>.</li>
          <li><span class="mono">Forward return</span>: <span class="mono">r_{t,h}=P_{t+h}/P_t - 1</span> for horizons <span class="mono">h</span> ∈ {1Y, 3Y, 5Y}.</li>
          <li><span class="mono">Evidence vs baseline</span>: compare the distribution of <span class="mono">r_{s,h}</span> on similar days to the stock’s unconditional “any day” distribution.</li>
          <li><span class="mono">Alpha (intuition)</span>: higher when the similar-day median is meaningfully above the baseline median and the win rate is high.</li>
          <li><span class="mono">Reliability</span>: smaller when <span class="mono">N</span> is low or outcomes are noisy; Stability favors patterns that don’t depend on one regime or one episode.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="footnote">
          Nothing here eliminates risk: it’s a conditional historical summary, not a promise. Use it as an evidence layer, not as a mandate.
