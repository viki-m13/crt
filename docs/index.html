                <p>
                  Rebound Ledger runs once a day and surfaces stocks that look <strong>unusually washed-out for their own history</strong> —
                  <strong>and checks that the weakness is stock-specific, not just “the market fell”</strong>.
                  Then it answers the only question that matters: <em>when this exact stock looked like this before, what happened next?</em>
                  You get forward outcome summaries for 1, 3, and 5 years, plus evidence comparing “signal days” to that stock’s normal baseline.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This is not “price is down, therefore buy.”
                  A -8% move means something totally different for a low-vol staple than for a high-beta growth name.
                  The model is <strong>stock-specific</strong> and <strong>market-adjusted</strong>, so a broad market selloff doesn’t masquerade as a signal.
                  It looks for <em>idiosyncratic</em> weakness (the part you can’t explain away with SPY).
                </p>

                <div class="section-title section-title--spaced">What this is not</div>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Not market advice.</strong> It does not tell you what you “should” own or how to build your portfolio.</li>
                  <li><strong>Not a trading strategy.</strong> No entries/exits, position sizing, timing rules, or risk management plan.</li>
                  <li><strong>Not a forecast.</strong> It summarizes historical outcomes; it does not predict the future.</li>
                  <li><strong>Not a guarantee.</strong> Stocks can keep falling — including to zero.</li>
                </ul>

                  <li>
                    <strong>Measure “washout.”</strong>
                    The <strong>Washout Meter (0–100)</strong> summarizes drawdown vs the 52-week high, position inside the 52-week range,
                    volatility/volume stress, and <strong>market-adjusted weakness</strong>.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Remove the “market did it” excuse.</strong>
                    The model estimates each stock’s rolling sensitivity to SPY and analyzes the residual (stock-specific) component.
                    That’s why this is not just mean reversion: it’s looking for <em>abnormal</em> weakness for that stock after accounting for the market.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Measure “reversal readiness.”</strong>
                    The <strong>Edge Score (0–100)</strong> is a simple, stock-specific “is this selloff stabilizing?” gauge built from short-term trend, gaps, and volume stress.
                    (No cross-stock comparisons; everything is measured within each ticker.)
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Define “signal days” from the stock’s own history.</strong>
                    A day counts as a <strong>signal</strong> when its <strong>Final Score</strong> lands in that stock’s historical <strong>top 10%</strong>.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Show evidence, not vibes.</strong>
                    The evidence block compares outcomes after <strong>signal days</strong> versus that stock’s <strong>normal</strong> baseline (any random historical day).
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Rank by one consistent score.</strong>
                    <strong>Final Score (0–100)</strong> is Edge amplified by Washout — the single score used for ranking and the chart color.
                    Confidence/Stability penalize tiny sample sizes and unstable patterns.

                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Final score (0–100)</strong> = the ranked recommendation. It’s the Edge Score amplified by today’s Washout.</li>
                  <li><strong>Washout (0–100)</strong> = how washed-out/sold-off the stock looks vs its own history (market-adjusted).</li>
                  <li><strong>Confidence (0–100)</strong> = higher when there are more comparable past cases and behavior is consistent.</li>
                  <li><strong>Stability (0–100)</strong> = whether the score holds up under small, reasonable tweaks (higher = less fragile).</li>
                  <li><span class="mono">Chance of gain</span> = % of <strong>signal days</strong> where the forward return was positive.</li>
                  <li><span class="mono">Typical</span> = the median forward return (the “middle” outcome).</li>
                  <li><span class="mono">Downside (1 in 10)</span> = the 10th percentile (a bad-but-plausible case).</li>

                  <li>
                    <strong>Evidence</strong> compares the <strong>signal-day</strong> group to the stock’s normal baseline
                    so you can see whether being in the stock’s own top-decile Final Score historically added edge.

                  <strong>Rebound Ledger — how the model works (plain English)</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Each day, for every stock, it measures how “beaten down” the stock is compared with its own past: drawdown from the last
                  1‑year high, where today sits inside its 1‑year and 3‑month ranges, and whether volume and volatility look stressed.
                  It also subtracts out the market’s move by estimating the stock’s beta to SPY and looking at the residual
                  (<span class="mono">stock − beta×SPY</span>), so a stock can still look washed‑out even if the whole market fell.
                  Those metrics form a single “today snapshot” for the stock.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The model computes a <strong>Final Score</strong> for every historical day of the stock using only information available up to that day.
                  A day is labeled a <strong>signal day</strong> if its Final Score lands in that stock’s own historical <strong>top 10%</strong>.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The forward-return blocks (1, 3, 5 years) are then simple summary statistics over those signal days: the fraction that were positive
                  (<span class="mono">chance of gain</span>), the median (<span class="mono">typical</span>), and the 10th percentile
                  (<span class="mono">downside (1 in 10)</span>). The <strong>Evidence</strong> section compares that signal-day group to the unconditional
                  baseline (any random day for the stock).
                </p>

                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Outlier</strong> = “unusually washed‑out vs itself” + “historically did better after its own high-score (signal) days.” No trained ML model.</li>
