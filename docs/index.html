                <p>
                  Rebound Ledger runs once a day and surfaces stocks that look <strong>unusually washed-out for their own history</strong> —
                  <strong>and checks that the weakness is stock-specific, not just “the market fell”</strong>.
                  Then it answers the only question that matters: <em>when this exact stock looked like this before, what happened next?</em>
                  You get forward outcome summaries for 1, 3, and 5 years, plus evidence comparing “signal days” to that stock’s normal baseline.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This is not “price is down, therefore buy.”
                  A -8% move means something totally different for a low-vol staple than for a high-beta growth name.
                  The model is <strong>stock-specific</strong> and <strong>market-adjusted</strong>, so a broad market selloff doesn’t masquerade as a signal.
                  It looks for <em>idiosyncratic</em> weakness (the part you can’t explain away with SPY).
                </p>

                <div class="section-title" style="margin-top:14px">What this is not</div>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Not market advice.</strong> It does not tell you what you “should” own or how to build your portfolio.</li>
                  <li><strong>Not a trading strategy.</strong> No entries/exits, position sizing, timing rules, or risk management plan.</li>
                  <li><strong>Not a forecast.</strong> It summarizes historical outcomes; it does not predict the future.</li>
                  <li><strong>Not a guarantee.</strong> Stocks can keep falling — including to zero.</li>
                </ul>
              </div>

              <div>
                <div class="section-title">How it works</div>
                <ol>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Measure “washout.”</strong>
                    The <strong>Washout Meter (0–100)</strong> summarizes drawdown vs the 52-week high, position inside the 52-week range,
                    volatility/volume stress, and <strong>market-adjusted weakness</strong>.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Remove the “market did it” excuse.</strong>
                    The model estimates each stock’s rolling sensitivity to SPY and analyzes the residual (stock-specific) component.
                    That’s why this is not just mean reversion: it’s looking for <em>abnormal</em> weakness for that stock after accounting for the market.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Match historical analogs (same stock).</strong>
                    It searches the stock’s own history for the most similar days (same stock, similar conditions), then measures what happened next.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Compute two kinds of evidence.</strong>
                    <strong>Evidence A</strong> compares outcomes after the stock’s <strong>top-10% most washed-out days</strong> versus <strong>any normal day</strong>.
                    <strong>Evidence B</strong> compares outcomes after the stock’s <strong>top-10% Final Score days</strong> versus <strong>any normal day</strong>.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Rank by one consistent score.</strong>
                    <strong>Edge Score (0–100)</strong> measures rebound edge from analogs.
                    <strong>Final Score (0–100)</strong> amplifies Edge by how washed-out it is today — this is the single score used for ranking and the chart color.
                    Confidence/Stability penalize “one lucky episode” patterns.
                  </li>
                </ol>

                <div class="section-title">How to read the numbers</div>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Final score (0–100)</strong> = the ranked recommendation. It’s the Edge Score amplified by today’s Washout.</li>
                  <li><strong>Washout (0–100)</strong> = how washed-out/sold-off the stock looks vs its own history (market-adjusted).</li>
                  <li><strong>Confidence (0–100)</strong> = higher when there are more comparable past cases and behavior is consistent.</li>
                  <li><strong>Stability (0–100)</strong> = whether the score holds up under small, reasonable tweaks (higher = less fragile).</li>
                  <li><span class="mono">Chance of gain</span> = % of similar past days where the forward return was positive.</li>
                  <li><span class="mono">Typical</span> = the median forward return (the “middle” outcome).</li>
                  <li><span class="mono">Downside (1 in 10)</span> = the 10th percentile (a bad-but-plausible case).</li>
                  <li><span class="mono">Based on N</span> = how many historical analog days were used (bigger N = more evidence).</li>
                  <li>
                    The <strong>Evidence A/B</strong> bullets inside each card compare “signal days” to that stock’s <em>typical</em>
                    outcomes — that’s how you see whether the signal historically added edge for that specific ticker.
