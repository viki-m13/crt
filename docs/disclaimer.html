      <h1>Disclaimer</h1>
      <p class="legal-updated">Last updated: February 23, 2026</p>

      <h2>Investment Disclaimer</h2>
      <p><strong>Daily Stock Guide is not a registered investment advisor, broker-dealer, or financial planner.</strong> The Site and all its content are provided for informational and educational purposes only. Nothing on this Site constitutes financial advice, investment advice, tax advice, legal advice, or any other form of professional advice.</p>

      <h2>No Recommendation or Solicitation</h2>
      <p>The inclusion of any stock, ticker symbol, score, probability, or analysis on this Site does not constitute a recommendation, endorsement, or solicitation to buy, sell, or hold any security. The Opportunity Score and all associated metrics are the result of automated historical pattern matching and do not represent a professional opinion on the future performance of any security.</p>

      <h2>Past Performance</h2>
      <p><strong>Past performance does not guarantee future results.</strong> This is a fundamental principle of investing that applies to all data presented on this Site. Historical probabilities, returns, and backtest results reflect outcomes under past market conditions that may never repeat. Markets are inherently unpredictable.</p>
      <p>Specifically:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A stock showing a high historical probability of recovery may decline further or go to zero.</li>
        <li>Backtest results showing positive returns from a DCA strategy are based on historical data and may not be replicated in the future.</li>
        <li>Statistical probabilities describe historical frequency, not future certainty.</li>
        <li>Market conditions, regulations, company fundamentals, and countless other factors change over time.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Risk of Loss</h2>
      <p><strong>Investing in stocks involves substantial risk, including the possible loss of your entire investment.</strong> Stocks that have experienced significant price declines — which are the focus of this Site — may carry even higher risk. A stock that has dropped significantly may continue to drop, may never recover, or the company may go bankrupt.</p>
      <p>You should never invest money that you cannot afford to lose. You should never make investment decisions based solely on information from any single source, including this Site.</p>

      <h2>Do Your Own Research</h2>
      <p>Before making any investment decision, you should:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Conduct your own thorough research and analysis</li>
        <li>Consider your personal financial situation, risk tolerance, and investment objectives</li>
        <li>Consult with a qualified, licensed financial advisor</li>
        <li>Read the company's financial statements, SEC filings, and other official disclosures</li>
        <li>Understand the specific risks associated with any investment</li>
        <li>Never rely solely on any single tool, score, or metric to make investment decisions</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Data Accuracy</h2>
      <p>The data presented on this Site is sourced from third-party providers and processed through automated algorithms. We do not guarantee the accuracy, completeness, or timeliness of any data. Errors may occur in data collection, processing, or presentation. Stock prices, financial data, and derived metrics may be delayed, incorrect, or incomplete.</p>
      <p>We are not responsible for any decisions made based on inaccurate or incomplete data.</p>

      <h2>Backtest Limitations</h2>
      <p>Backtest results shown on the Site are hypothetical and have inherent limitations:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>They are based on historical data and do not account for future market conditions.</li>
        <li>They do not account for transaction costs, taxes, slippage, or other real-world trading frictions.</li>
        <li>They may suffer from survivorship bias (excluding companies that went bankrupt or were delisted).</li>
        <li>They assume perfect execution at stated prices, which may not be achievable in practice.</li>
        <li>Hypothetical results may overstate or understate the actual returns that would have been achieved.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>No Fiduciary Relationship</h2>
      <p>Your use of this Site does not create a fiduciary relationship, advisory relationship, or any other professional relationship between you and Daily Stock Guide or its owner(s). We owe you no duty of care, loyalty, or any other fiduciary obligation.</p>

      <h2>Limitation of Liability</h2>
      <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, Daily Stock Guide, its owner(s), operators, affiliates, and contributors shall not be held liable for any damages whatsoever — including but not limited to direct, indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages — arising from or related to your use of the Site or any investment decisions made in connection with information obtained from the Site.</p>
      <p>This limitation of liability applies regardless of whether the damages are based on warranty, contract, tort, negligence, strict liability, or any other legal theory, and whether or not we have been advised of the possibility of such damages.</p>

      <h2>Regulatory Notice</h2>
      <p>Daily Stock Guide is not registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), or any state securities regulatory authority. The Site does not provide regulated financial services.</p>

      <h2>Acceptance</h2>
      <p>By using this Site, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to this Disclaimer, our <a href="terms.html">Terms of Service</a>, and our <a href="privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a>. If you do not agree, you must stop using the Site immediately.</p>
